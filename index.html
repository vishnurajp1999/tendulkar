            <h2>Article</h2>
            <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar BR  born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18000 runs and 15000 runs respectively in total.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6] Known for his large fanbase and described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most worshipped player in the world',[7] Tendulkar is sometimes referred to as "The God of Cricket" in India. A film with that name was released in 2021.[8]

                Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[9] Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[10] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.
                
                Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.[11][12] A few hours after the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[13][14] As of 2021, he is the youngest recipient to date and was the first sportsperson to receive the award.[15][16] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[17]
                
                In 2010, Time magazine included Tendulkar in its annual Time 100 list as one of the most influential people in the world.[18] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 ICC Awards.[19] Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012,[20][21] he retired from all forms of cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match.[22] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[23] In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI compiled in 2013 to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist batsman of the post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team.[24] In 2019 he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.</p>
                <h2>Early years</h2>
                <p>Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 [26] [27][28][29] to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin Maharastrian family[30][31][32] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist & poet and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[33] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[34][35]

                    Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[36]
                    
                    Tendulkar also showed an interest in tennis that was on an equal level to cricket. He particularly idolised American player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands, and carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.[37][38][39]
                    
                    To help curb his mischievous, bullying tendencies, Ajit Tendulkar, his elder brother introduced Sachin to cricket in 1984. He introduced him to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the Sachin did not able to play his best game. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[40][better source needed] Ajit Tendulkar also had experience of playing cricket in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[41]
                    
                    Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School,[27] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[42] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[43] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.</p>

            <h1>Playing style</h1>
            <p>Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[322][323] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[27] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia.[27] He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[324] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[325] Equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.[326]

                Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[327][328]

                Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[329] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.[329] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".[330]
                
                Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, especially in his later years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[331]
                
                
                Tendulkar has taken 201 wickets across all three formats of the international game.
                While Tendulkar was not a regular bowler, he could bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowled when two batsmen of the opposite team had been batting together for a long period, as he could often be a useful partnership breaker.[332] With his bowling, he helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[333] He took 201 international wickets—46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's twelfth-highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[334]

                Tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst Australian crowds, where Tendulkar has consistently scored centuries.[81] One of the most popular sayings by his fans is "Cricket is my religion and Sachin is my God".[335] Cricinfo mentions in his profile that "... Tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped[clarification needed] cricketer in the world."[27][additional citation(s) needed]
                
                During the Australian tour of India in 1998 Matthew Hayden said "I have seen God. He bats at no. 4 in India in Tests."[336] However, on God, Tendulkar himself is reported to have said "I am not God of cricket. I make mistakes, God doesn't."[337] Tendulkar made a special appearance in the Bollywood film Stumped in 2003, appearing as himself.[338][unreliable fringe source?]
                
                On 24 February 2010, Cricinfo site could not handle the heavy traffic experienced after Tendulkar broke the record for the highest individual male score in a One Day International match against South Africa, also becoming the first player to score 200* in the history of ODIs as more than 5 million fans visited the website at a time.[339][340]
                
                There have been many instances when Tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. As reported by many Indian newspapers, a young man hanged himself due to distress over Tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.[341]
                
                At home in Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. Ian Chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".[330] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence.[342] Tendulkar has had a presence in the popular social networking site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt since May 2010.[343]</p>
